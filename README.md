### Introduction
**VibeChecks** is a lightweight python package that allows users to use natural language (LLMs) as part of their code logic. For example, **VibeChecks** can be used to check if/loop statements as well as provide responses for functions that are described but not implemented. It supports OpenAI and Google Gemini client currently and asimple example illustrating how it can be used can be seen below:
```
from google import genai
from vibechecks import VibeCheck

# initialize client
client = genai.Client(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)

# wrap it in VibeCheck
vc = VibeCheck(client, model="gemini-2.0-flash-lite")

# logic below vibechecks if a user input number is prime
user_input = input("Enter a number:")
if vc(f"{user_input} is a prime number"):
    print(f"{user_input} is a prime number!")
else:
    print(f"{user_input} is not a prime number.")
```

**VibeChecks** is published on [**pypi**](https://pypi.org/project/vibechecks/) and can be easily installed with:
```
python3 -m pip install vibechecks
```
Details on the usage of the package and available APIs can be found on the [**wiki page**](https://github.com/konglyyy/vibechecks/wiki).

### Features
- **Natural Language Conditions**: Use natural language to check for conditions, making your code more readable and intuitive.
- **Multi-provider Support**: Seamlessly switch between different LLM providers. VibeChecks currently supports OpenAI and Google Gemini.
- **Extensible**: The modular design allows for easy extension to other LLM providers in the future.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Provides custom exceptions for better error handling and debugging.
